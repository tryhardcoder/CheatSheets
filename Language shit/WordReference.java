// Parameter or Argument
//  (they are the same thing) (wack ass names)
// Something a function takes in
void logX(String s) {

}
// "S" is a parameter of "logX"






// Method
// the same thing as a function
class vector {
    float len() { return float.INFINITY; }
}
// "len" is a method









// Instance
public class Vec { double x, y; }
// ^ this is the class, which defines what an instance looks like

Vec v = new Vec();
//  ^ "v" is an instance of "vec"
// It's an object that has been created, with the type vec









// Instance variables

// variables that are created for every single instance of a class
class Vec {
    double x = 0;
    double y = 0;
    public static double z;
}
// "x" and "y" are instance variables.
//  "Z" isn't because it's associated with the class, not a particular instance.










// Compiler
// The thing that makes your java code into something the computer can process
//// (stuff a computer can run is called machine code)


// Language server
// this is the goddamn JDK that keeps on breaking.
// There is no reason you need to know what it's called. I'm just mad.
