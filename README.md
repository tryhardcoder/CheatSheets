# What this shit is

These are a bunch of files meant to be used as cheat-sheets when learning programming in FRC. (None of them will actually compile.) It's recommended you turn of linting when viewing the files in this project. Some areas are specific to our teams codebase, but anything in the "Language shit" or "FRC Specific" folders should be fairly generic. Also keep in mind that a lot of "best practices" aren't really mentioned in here.

# Language Shit

The "Language shit" folder contains information and explainations about the basics of code. It's fairly language generic, but is intended for people learning java.

# FRC Specific Folder

Anything that you might need to start your own FRC repo and get some hardware running (not including hardware or firmware setup) is in here. It has basic things about the structure of an FRC project, and simpler, offline docs for hardware objects.

# 4536 2023

This folder has docs and starting resources for people to understand this years codebase and architecture. Going custom may have been a mistake.
